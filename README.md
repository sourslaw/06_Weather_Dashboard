## Description
- A weather dashboard . . .

### The User Story for this project is as follows:
- AS A traveler, I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

### The codebase meets the following criteria for acceptance:
- WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- WHEN I click into a timeblock, THEN I can enter an event
- WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
- WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist
- WHEN I search for a city, THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city, THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
- WHEN I view the UV index, THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city, THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history, THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
